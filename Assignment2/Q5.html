                    A much-anticipated review of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) levies on life and health insurance policies was put off by the apex body in charge of the indirect tax regime, the GST Council at its 55th meeting on Saturday (December 21, 2024), as some members sought more discussions on the matter before taking a final call.

                    A Group of Ministers (GoM) under Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Samrat Chaudhary is now expected to meet afresh to deliberate on the insurance levies once more before coming back to the Council with its recommendations. Moreover, rate rationalisation suggestions pertaining to about 150 items, including a price-based differential levy for garments, and 5% levies for packaged drinking water, and bicycles priced under ₹10,000, were also put off till the Council’s next meeting.

            <h2>How scientists are exploring what extraterrestrial life could look like</h2>
            Advanced forms of life on alien planets could be so strange that they are unrecognisable<br>

We have only one example of biology forming in the universe: life on earth. But what if life can form in other ways? How do you look for alien life when you don’t know what alien life might look like?
                </li>
                <li>
                    These questions are preoccupying astrobiologists, who are scientists who look for life beyond earth. Astrobiologists have attempted to come up with universal rules that govern the emergence of complex physical and biological systems both on earth and beyond.
