It is important to recognize that there is no single definition of gender and that it varies from culture to culture. <br>
However, in general, gender refers to the social and cultural roles that are assigned to people based on their sex. <br>
These roles can vary greatly from person to person but they should not be viewed as limiting. <br>
Unfortunately, in patriarchal societies, men are entitled to have more power, money, and several other privileges than women. <br>
The differences in power dynamics between the two genders have kept women away from the decision-making process and have oppressed them in many ways. <br>
A society where people experience oppression, violence, and discrimination because of their gender is not sustainable and can not achieve true prosperity.<br>
Without equality, there is no justice. Without justice, there is no peace.  <br>

                    We must also acknowledge that gender-based discrimination faced by women is not the same for everybody. <br>
                    This is an intersectional issue. The life experience of a woman depends on her race, ethnicity, socioeconomic class, and physical ability. <br>
                    For instance, the experience of oppression faced by a privileged, upper-class, white woman in the USA is not comparable to the oppression <br>
                    and discrimination faced by a differently abled, poor woman from a racially marginalized community.  
                    <br>
                    Unfortunately, many people still believe that there are differences between the genders. <br>
                    But regardless of the differences, we should aim to create a society where everyone feels safe, and everyone has equal access and rights to opportunity. <br>
